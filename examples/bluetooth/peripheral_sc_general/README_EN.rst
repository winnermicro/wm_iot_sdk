Overview
********

Application demonstrating the BLE Peripheral role. Similar to the :ref:`Peripheral <ble_peripheral_general_sample_en>` sample, except that this
application supporting security feature. After establishing the connection, several cli commands help to finish pairing procedure.

	[I] (63312) sc_peripheral: LE conn param updated: 79:43:31:D9:97:99 (random) int 0x0006 lat 0 to 500
	[I] (63632) sc_peripheral: LE conn param updated: 79:43:31:D9:97:99 (random) int 0x0014 lat 0 to 500
	
4. Perform ``BOND`` on nRF Connect APP

.. figure:: assert/peripheral_sc_general_bonding_en.svg
    :align: center
	
5. Upon receiving a bonding request, development board B outputs the pairing code **158833** with the following log information.
