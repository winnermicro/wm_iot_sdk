Overview
********

This example demonstrates the Apple iBeacon functionality. Once the program is running, it starts broadcasting Apple's iBeacon data packets. 
The signal strength of the broadcast packets can be adjusted through IBEACON_RSSI (e.g., IBEACON_RSSI=0xb8 corresponds to -72 dBm RSSI at 1 meter).

Requirements
************

* A board with BLE support
* nRF Connect APP

Running result
***************

1. Successfully running will output the following logs

.. code-block:: console

	I/ibeacon         [0.002] Starting iBeacon Demo
