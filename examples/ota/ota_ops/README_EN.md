# OTA_OPS

## Overview
This application is a comprehensive example of using the `WM IoT SDK` with the `wm_ota_ops` API interface for device firmware upgrade functionality. It demonstrates how to handle OTA updates, including initializing OTA operations, reading firmware image data, writing data to the device's OTA partition, and restarting the device after completion. Based on the `wm_ota_ops` API interface, various upgrade solutions can be implemented and connected to multiple IoT platforms. Here is the overall OTA architecture:

![OTA Architecture](./figure/ota_architecture.svg)

## Requirements

1. `main/src/atcmd_ota.img` is the upgrade firmware embedded in the code, sourced from the OTA upgrade firmware generated by compiling `examples/atcmd`. If you need to modify it to other firmware, you can refer to [Build System - Embedding Files in Code](https://doc.winnermicro.net/w800/en/latest/component_guides/build_system.html#embedding-files-in-code)

2. The partition table used in this project must include the `app_ota` partition. For the partition table, please refer to [Partition Table Mechanism](https://doc.winnermicro.net/w800/en/latest/component_guides/partition_table.html)
