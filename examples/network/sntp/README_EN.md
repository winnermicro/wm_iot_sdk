# Using SNTP to obtain network clock

## Overview
This example demonstrates how to synchronize network clocks through SNTP.

1. Connect to the designated router
2. Start SNTP
3. Query the default SNTP server domain name
4. Set the time zone to Beijing time "UTC+8"
5. Obtain network time through default SNTP server
6. Set the specified SNTP domain name and obtain the network time
7. Set the specified SNTP IP address and obtain the network time

## Requirements

1.Configure the WiFi SSID and WiFi Password in menuconfig.
2.SSID configuration path: SNTP example configuration -> WiFi SSID.
3.Password configuration path: SNTP example configuration -> WiFi Password.
