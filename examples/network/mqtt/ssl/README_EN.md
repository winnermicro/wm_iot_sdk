# MQTT over SSL

## Overview
This example connects to the broker URI by using MQTT SSL and as a demonstration subscribes/unsubscribes and send a message on certain topic.
(Please note that the public broker is maintained by the community so may not be always available, for details please see this [disclaimer](https://iot.eclipse.org/getting-started/#sandboxes))

PEM certificate for this example could be extracted from an openssl `s_client` command connecting to mqtt.eclipseprojects.io.
In case a host operating system has `openssl` and `sed` packages installed, one could execute the following command to download and save the root certificate to a file (Note for Windows users: Both Linux like environment or Windows native packages may be used).
```
echo "" | openssl s_client -showcerts -connect mqtt.eclipseprojects.io:8883 | sed -n "1,/Root/d; /BEGIN/,/END/p" | openssl x509 -outform PEM >mqtt_eclipseprojects_io.pem
```
Please note that this is not a general command for downloading a root certificate for an arbitrary host;
this command works with mqtt.eclipseprojects.io as the site provides root certificate in the chain, 
which then could be extracted with text operation.

## Requirements
1. A working AP is required.
2. Configure WiFi SSID and WiFi Password in menuconfig.
3. Configure the Broker URL in menuconfig.
4. A PEM certificate is required. It defaults to mian/src/mqtt_eclipseprojects_io.pem.
