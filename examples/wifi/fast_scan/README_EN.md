# fast_scan

## Overview

This example demonstrates how to use Wi-Fi to quickly scan the functional connection AP.

It supports fast scan and full-channel scan.

- `Fast Scan` : In this mode, the scan ends as soon as a matching AP is detected, even if all channel have not been fully scanned. You can set a threshold for signal strength and select the desired authentication mode provided by the AP. The Wi-Fi driver will ignore APS that do not meet the above criteria.
- `Full-Channel Scan` : Only end when the scan is complete. The ranking method of APS includes signal strength and authentication mode. After scanning, the Wi-Fi driver selects the most suitable AP.

After scanning, Wi-Fi will try to connect. In most cases, the AP with the best signal strength is connected.

## Requirements
1. A properly connected AP is required.
2. Configure WiFi SSID and WiFi Password in menuconfig .
