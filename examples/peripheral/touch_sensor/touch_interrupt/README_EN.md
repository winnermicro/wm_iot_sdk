# Touch Sensor Interrupt

## Overview

This example demonstrates the use of a touch sensor interrupt function.

## Requirements

Touch sensor keys are connected in the following table:

| IO Number | IO Nmae   | Touch Number  |
| :-------- | :-------: | :------------ |
| 16        | PB0       | 3             |
| 17        | PB0       | 4             |
| 18        | PB0       | 5             |
| 12        | PA12      | CMOD          |
| 14        | PA14      | CMC           |
