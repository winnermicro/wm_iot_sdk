# PWM Output

## Overview

Upon startup, this application performs the following operations:

1. Initialize the PWM controller driver.
2. Bind and initialize GPIO 28 (PB12) for PWM channel 0.
3. Initialize PWM channel 0 with specific parameters for independent output mode.
4. Start the independent output of PWM channel 0.
5. Observe whether the LED is lit.
6. The PWM will continuously output a waveform with a periodically changing duty cycle, which means the LED light will gradually dim and then become brighter.

## Environment Requirements

1. Demo uses an EVB board
2. Board with onboard LED bind with the configured GPIO

## Compilation and Flashing
