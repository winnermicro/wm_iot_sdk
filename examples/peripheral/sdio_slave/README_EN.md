# SDIO Slave

## Overview

This application is an example of SDIO slave communication using the `WM IoT SDK`. It demonstrates how to use the `wm_drv_sdio_slave` driver APIs from the `WM IoT SDK` for data transfer between host and slave. The example includes both synchronous and asynchronous data transfers, as well as command and data reception handling.

## Requirements

Hardware environment that supports SDIO slave functionality and an SDIO host device are required.

- W80x development board
- Host device with SDIO master interface (e.g. another MCU or development board)
- Connection cables

CIS (Card Information Structure) defines the information structure of the card. CIS contains both common CIS (Function 0) and Function 1 port's respective CIS. The `fn_regs` defined in the `cis.c` file is just a CIS configuration reference, users can modify it according to their own SDIO card type.
