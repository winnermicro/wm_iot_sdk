            The idle task has its own stack, sized in word. The default size is enough for most uses.

            The stack size may need to be increased above the default if the app installs idle or thread local storage
            cleanup hooks that use a lot of stack memory.

            Changes the maximum task name length. Each task allocated will
            include this many bytes for a task name. Using a shorter value
            saves a small amount of RAM, a longer value allows more complex
            names.

                FreeRTOS uses the queue registry as a means for kernel aware debuggers to locate queues, semaphores,
                and mutexes. The registry allows for a textual name to be associated with a queue for easy identification
                within a debugging GUI. A value of 0 will disable queue registry functionality, and a value larger than 0
                will specify the number of queues/semaphores/mutexes that the registry can hold.

        help
            FreeRTOS provides a set of timer related API functions. Many of these functions use a standard
            FreeRTOS queue to send commands to the timer service task. The queue used for this purpose is
            called the 'timer command queue'. The 'timer command queue' is private to the FreeRTOS timer
            implementation, and cannot be accessed directly.
